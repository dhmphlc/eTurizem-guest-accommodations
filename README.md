# eTurizem guest accommodations

This was a school project that I am quite proud of.
The idea of the app is to help generate XML files for eTurizem web app that records the stays of guests in accommodation facilites (hotels, motels, apartments ...).

App is using an **sqlConnection** to connect to a **Microsoft SQL Server**, to a database called **eTurizem**.
In the database there are three tables (accommodation_facilities, accommodation_units and guest_book).

*The app was only tested on locally hosted MsSQL database and may not work with external databases*

---
> **This app is not a finished product that will guarantee a 100% correctness of your XML files nor the flawless execution of all functionalities; it may encounter limitations or unforeseen issues during use.**
